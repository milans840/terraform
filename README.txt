This Terraform script creates a robust infrastructure setup in AWS for deploying and managing scalable applications. Here's a breakdown of the components:
This is an example of EC2 auto-scaling based on memory utilization
Provider Configuration
Provider: Sets AWS as the cloud provider and specifies the us-east-1 region.
VPC Setup
VPC:

CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16.
DNS support and hostnames enabled.
Tag: example-vpc.
Internet Gateway:

Connects the VPC to the internet.
Tag: example-internet-gateway.
Subnet:

CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24.
Public IP addresses assigned automatically.
Located in us-east-1a.
Tag: example-subnet.
Route Table:

Directs internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet gateway.
Tag: example-route-table.
Route Table Association:

Associates the subnet with the route table.
Security Group
allow_ssh:
Allows SSH traffic on port 22 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
Enables outbound traffic to all destinations.
IAM Roles and Policies
IAM Role (example):

Allows EC2 instances to assume a role for accessing AWS services.
CloudWatch Agent Policy:

Grants permissions for monitoring and logging to CloudWatch.
Policy includes actions for metrics, logs, EC2, and auto-scaling.
IAM Role Policy Attachment:

Attaches the CloudWatch agent policy to the IAM role.
IAM Instance Profile:

Links the IAM role to EC2 instances.
Key Pair
Private Key:

Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair for SSH access.
Saves the private key locally with restricted permissions.
AWS Key Pair:

Registers the public key with AWS for EC2 instances.
Launch Template
Specifies configurations for launching EC2 instances:
Instance type: t2.micro.
AMI ID: ami-0453ec754f44f9a4a.
Key pair for SSH.
Public IP association.
Security group: allow_ssh.
User data script:
Installs CloudWatch Agent.
Fetches and configures agent settings from SSM Parameter Store.
SSM Parameter Store
asg_config:
Stores configuration for auto-scaling and CloudWatch metrics collection.
Auto Scaling Group
Auto Scaling Group:

Uses the launch template.
Subnet: example-subnet.
Min instances: 2, max instances: 20.
Desired capacity: 2.
Tag: example-instance.
Scaling Policies:

Scale Up: Increases capacity by 1 when triggered.
Scale Down: Decreases capacity by 1 when triggered.
CloudWatch Alarms
memory-high:

Triggers scale-up policy if memory utilization exceeds 10%.
Evaluates metrics every 60 seconds.
memory-low:

Triggers scale-down policy if memory utilization drops below 5%.
Evaluates metrics every 60 seconds.
Summary
This configuration builds a highly available and scalable AWS environment, including:

A VPC with internet access.
Secure EC2 instances with SSH access and CloudWatch monitoring.
Auto-scaling capabilities to handle fluctuating workloads.
CloudWatch alarms to dynamically adjust scaling based on memory usage.
